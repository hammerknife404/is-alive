```powershell
cargo build --release
# -> target\release\is-alive.exe
```

Cross-compile from Linux: `rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`, install `mingw-w64`, then
`cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.

## Screenshots for UI work

`IS_ALIVE_SHOTS=<dir>` makes the app visit every tab, save `<dir>/NN-<tab>.png` of each, and close.
For the Map with data, make the fictional demo map and open it at the same time:

```sh
python3 scripts/demo-map.py demo.dc.html
IS_ALIVE_SHOTS=shots ./is-alive demo.dc.html
```

`IS_ALIVE_SHOTS_SELECT=<card id>` picks the card selected for the Map panel shot, and `IS_ALIVE_SHOTS_CLIENTS=some` (or `all`) starts the Map with clients shown. On a pull request that touches `src/`, the **screenshots** workflow runs the tour in Dark and Light and attaches the images as an artifact.

## Linux AppImage

```sh
packaging/linux/build-appimage.sh
# -> target/appimage/is-alive-x86_64.AppImage
```

Downloads `appimagetool` on first run (or set `APPIMAGETOOL=/path/to/appimagetool`). Only glibc is linked; GL, X11/Wayland and xkbcommon load from the host at runtime (`libxkbcommon-x11`, which stock Ubuntu lacks, is bundled), so the AppImage runs on any desktop distro with glibc ≥ the build host's (CI builds on Ubuntu 22.04 → glibc 2.35).

On Linux, ICMP uses unprivileged ping sockets (`SOCK_DGRAM`/`IPPROTO_ICMP`) — no root, no capabilities. That needs your group inside `net.ipv4.ping_group_range`, the default on Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch and most systemd distros. If it's not, the app falls back to the system `ping` command.

CI builds the `.exe` and the `.AppImage` on every push/PR (Actions artifacts).

Versions: a release with new features bumps the minor number (0.11.0); fixes and polish between feature releases bump the patch (0.11.1, 0.11.2, …).

To release, bump `version` in `Cargo.toml` (and `Cargo.lock`) in a PR and merge it to `main`: CI tags `v<version>`, publishes a GitHub release with both binaries and checksums, and generates release notes from the PRs merged since the last release. Pushing a `v*` tag by hand does the same, as long as it matches `Cargo.toml`.

On other platforms (macOS etc.) ICMP falls back to the system `ping` command (dev/testing only).
